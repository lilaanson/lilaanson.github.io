                    <p>Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest conductor Aram Demirjian present a powerhouse program highlighted by Vivaldi’s programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures the essence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter through music that manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its debut. Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in its return to Boettcher Concert Hall. The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on fate that endures as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements, Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of humanity’s most powerful works of art. Among today’s best and brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit of dance, movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic celebration that will have you on the edge of your seat.;

                    <p>History is replete with turning points and with the completion of his revolutionary Third Symphony,
                        Beethoven forever changed the idea of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and
                        Romantic eras, the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means to be human in a work that is
                        larger and more emotional than a symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion rises to the
                        forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very nature of humanity, while reimagining a future
                        for music filled with endless possibility. Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant
                        recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar’s Cello Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring
                        themes and quiet anguish that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes
                        center stage on Vaughan Williams ’Walt Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable
                        marriage of music and text, with Williams ’inspired music perfectly encapsulating Whitman’s noble,
                        humanistic aspirations. These works will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your
                        Colorado Symphony.;
