        <h1> Hello world!</h1>
        <p>My name is Lila (she/her)</p>
        <h2> About me</h2>
        <p>I am a sophomore CTD major! In my free time I like to rock climb.</p>
        <P>Lately I have been super interested in learning to climb outdoors but I've been waiting until the weather gets warm again.</P>
        <h3> My plans for Web</h3>
        <p>In this course I hope to gain the skills to code my own website (functionally and aesthetically) instead of using wix!</p>
