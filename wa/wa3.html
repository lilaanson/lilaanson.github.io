<p style="font-size: 20px"><em>Lost</em> is an American science fiction drama television series created by Jeffrey Lieber, J. J. Abrams, and Damon Lindelof that aired on ABC from September 22, 2004, to May 23, 2010, over six seasons. It was one of the first early TV shows to garner a huge internet and social media reaction, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost:_Missing_Pieces">spin-off shows</a>, conspiracy theories, and its own <a href="https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">"Lostpedia"</a> website. </p>

<h2 id="Plot">Plot</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px"><em>Lost </em>follows the survivors of a commercial jet airliner flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, after the plane crashes on a mysterious island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. During their intitial attempts to get off the island, their attention is quickly turned to what may already be on the island. Throughout the series, each character's odd connections to each other and to the island are explored, as well as their individual troubling histories.</p>

<h2 id="MainCast">Main Cast</h2>
<p><em>Character descriptions do not contain major spoilers, but do have some information discovered throughout the first season! Read at your own risk!</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Characters change dramatically throughout each season, but the main cast of season 1 and their initial perceptions are as follows:</p>
<a href="/img/jack"><img src="/img/jack" width="400" alt="Jack Shepherd"></a>
<p style="font-size: 20px"><strong>Jack Shephard</strong><br>Dr. Jack Shephard, M.D., was an American spinal surgeon and the plane crash survivors' de facto leader. Before the crash, his obsessive personality wrecked his marriage and his relationship with his father. On the Island, though, the survivors sought his guidance during many crises and missions, and he united them until they cooperated and formed a society.</p>

<a href="/img/Sayid.png"><img src="/img/Sayid.png" width="300" alt="Sayid Jarrah"></a>
<p style="font-size: 20px"><strong>Sayid Jarrah</strong><br>Sayid Hassan Jarrah was a middle section survivor of Oceanic Flight 815 and a former Iraqi Republican Guard torturer. A courageous man and a competent leader, Sayid maintained a conservative manner which reflected his strength and spirituality.</p>

<img src="/img/hugo.jpg" width="450" alt="Hurley Reyes">
<p style="font-size: 20px"><strong>Hurley Reyes</strong><br>Hugo Reyes, more commonly known by his nickname "Hurley", was one of the middle section survivors (seat 20G) of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Hurley's father disappeared when he was ten and did not return until Hurley was 27. During his father's absence, Hurley developed an eating disorder, and later a traumatic accident landed him in a mental asylum where he started seeing an imaginary person. He was overly-conscious about his sanity and weight afterwards. While employed at Mr. Cluck's, Hurley won the lottery by playing the numbers given to him by Lenny. Due to a series of unfortunate incidents following his win, he believed himself to be plagued with bad luck because of the numbers and searched for an answer to the curse.</p>

<img src="/img/sawyer" width="450" alt="Sawyer Ford">
<p style="font-size: 20px"><strong>Sawyer Ford</strong><br>James Ford, better known by the alias Sawyer, and known to the DHARMA Initiative as Jim LaFleur, is one of the middle section survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. His rural Southern accent, selfishness, machismo, and folksy use of oft-abrasive nicknames belied his sophisticated and tender sides as an avid reader and a caring loverâ€”elements of his personality that started to become more apparent as he spent more time on the Island.</p>

<img src="/img/kate.jpg" width="300" alt="Kate Austen">
<p style="font-size: 20px"><strong>Kate Austen</strong><br>Katherine Anne Austen, more commonly known as Kate, is one of the survivors from the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Before the crash, Kate had spent many years fleeing the law after killing her abusive father. To achieve her goals, she would commit several other crimes and would turn to bank robbery, assault and seduction.</p>

<h2 id="Impact">Impact</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Lost's impact on TV culture cannot be overstated. <br> <br>According to <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a598676/whats-the-big-idea-how-lost-changed-the-game-for-us-television/">Digitalspy.com,</a> "Lost became a phenomenon almost immediately, with viewers averaging 17 million in its first season. 
    People were drawn in by the appealing concept, multi-cultural cast, inventive narrative (utilising flashbacks to showcase individual characters each week), and the undercurrent of something spookier going on."
    <br><br> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/8-ways-lost-changed-tv-forever/2900-1749/">Gamespot.com</a> mentions how "in its second year, ABC took Lost beyond the small-screen to connect with its growing online fanbase. Podcasting was still in its infancy but, with the help of co-showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, The Official Lost Podcast released in November of 2005. Twitter was still a year away from launching, but this didn't stop the network and the show's executive producers from latching onto some exciting new media trends.Not only were fans treated to weekly episodes of the podcast, where they were able to speculate on the mysteries of the series, Lindelof and Cuse were regularly featured in the show, helping to guide viewers on this journey by giving them behind-the-scenes tidbits, tease upcoming twists, and answer fan questions.</p>
